Clarification â€” DrawList Usage and Behavior (Iteration 13)

This entry documents clarifications provided by the user to refine the understanding of how DrawList works in NWScript NUI:

==========================
1. ResRef Source (NuiDrawListImage)
==========================
- ResRef must point to a valid resource present in the module or loaded through .hak files.
- Some system-defined resources are also available from the engine.
- In short: it must be a resolvable asset within the NWN content pipeline.

==========================
2. Dynamic Updates and Bindability
==========================
- Components that support `NuiBind` can be updated via `NuiSetBind` and read with `NuiGetBind`.
- NuiDrawList itself does not support bind updates, except for the `jScissor` parameter.
- Updating drawlist visuals requires full regeneration of layout (e.g., via NuiSetGroupLayout).

==========================
3. Interactivity in DrawList
==========================
- `NuiDrawListImage` accepts advanced parameters such as:
  - jEnabled, jResRef, jPos, jAspect, jHAlign, jVAlign
  - nOrder, nRender
- Notably, `nRender` allows conditional rendering on interaction:
  - 0 = Always
  - 1 = Mouse Off
  - 2 = Hover
  - 3 = Left Click
  - 4 = Right Click
  - 5 = Middle Click

This provides limited interactivity at the rendering level.

==========================
4. Technical Limits
==========================
- No explicit limits are confirmed, but user recommends minimizing number of elements for performance reasons.
- Limits may exist but are undocumented or dependent on platform/mod size.
