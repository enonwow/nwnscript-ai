Structures and event hooks are ready for reuse in project scripts.,,
2,data-feed/Nui Performance Considerations - NWN Lexicon.html,"Loaded NUI performance guide from NWN Lexicon; Identified key sections regarding layout depth, cassowary solver, use of NuiSpacer/Margin, and problems with dynamic UI resizing.",Integrate performance warnings as heuristics for GUI analysis; Detect deep layout nesting and expensive widgets like spacers; Auto-append notes to `next_iteration` if performance risks are found.,"Formulated best practices checklist for building efficient UIs; Identified common pitfalls such as nesting, scaling, and buffer overuse.",The performance guide provides essential NUI optimization principles. Key takeaways will inform future layout and interaction analyses.,,
3,data-feed/Nui basic example - NWN Lexicon.html,"Analyzed full usage example of NUI from NWN Lexicon; Recognized components (`text`, `button`, `textedit`, `bind`, `notify`); Extracted JSON structure and open/handle cycle.",Turn the example into a reusable GUI skeleton in `ai-scripts/`; Automate detection of `bind` and `onClick`; Use JSON layout as a reference in GUI unit tests.,Extracted layout structure and identifiers for binds/events; Mapped event-response relationships in the interface.,Provides a solid reference implementation of a basic GUI window. Ready to be used as a foundation for project-level components.,,
4,data-feed/NUI - Neverwinter Nights 1_ EE - nwn.wiki.html,"Parsed full wiki documentation on NUI; Mapped layout structure from root to children; Grouped widgets, layouts, binds, drawlists, and event handling methods.","Link layout tree model to GUI analyzers as a reference; Organize sections into API groups (`NuiOpen`, `Bind`, `DrawList`); Create syntax schema for validating layout correctness in .nss.",Classified components and layout logic; Connected styling rules with functional layout and event logic; Clarified differences between DrawList and standard controls.,This wiki entry contains comprehensive structural and interactive NUI reference. Can be directly applied to model validation and automated parsing.,,
5,data-feed/Category_NUI Functions - NWN Lexicon.html,"Parsed the main NUI category index on NWN Lexicon; Extracted a complete list of function names and subpages; Grouped functions into widgets, layout, style, events, and system categories.",Extend the parsing to include all subpages for full API extraction; Link functions with occurrences in `.nss` scripts; Auto-fill `function_map` entries based on this index.,Classified NUI functions by type and role; Identified missing integration points between documentation and code analysis.,This file is the top-level function index and can serve as an authoritative source for building a structured API reference and linking code to docs.,,
6,ai-scripts/NUI_menus_scripts/,"Unpacked ZIP archive from NeverwinterVault (NUI Menus); Scanned all .nss scripts for function definitions, usage of `json`, and `Nui_*` functions; Tagged scripts based on presence of `lib_nui`, JSON layout logic, or other GUI-related keywords.",Further trace indirect GUI logic possibly defined in included libraries; Verify if NUI is invoked dynamically via dispatching structures or wrapper functions; Correlate these scripts with external GUI XML or dialog definitions.,Classified scripts by JSON/NUI presence and potential GUI usage; Identified `0e_window.nss` as a candidate for GUI JSON structure analysis.,"Initial analysis of NUI Menus package showed limited direct NUI function calls. However, JSON structures in scripts suggest dynamic interface generation may occur via indirect means.",Rozpakuj plik zip w którym znajdują się skrypty. Po pełnej analizie dopisz kolejną iterację do pliku.,"nui,json,script_package,ai-scripts"
7,ai-scripts/NUI_menus_scripts/,"Re-evaluated the analysis of NUI Menus scripts using corrected pattern; Identified flawed assumption in regex (`Nui_*`) which missed valid NWScript-style functions like `NuiSetBind`, `NuiOpen`; Acknowledged oversight of previous knowledge from iteration 0 (e.g., `nw_inc_nui.nss` function naming conventions).",Unify function detection logic using a master list of known NUI functions; Incorporate context learned from previous iterations to prevent isolated parsing errors; Validate regex heuristics against test cases and known examples.,Updated regex to correctly detect NWScript function naming: `\bNui[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*\b`; Confirmed integration of knowledge from `nw_inc_nui.nss` to detect indirect or wrapped GUI logic.,"This iteration corrected a key analysis flaw: missing real `Nui*` functions due to an invalid pattern. Future iterations will reuse accumulated context (e.g., function names) to ensure accuracy and continuity.",Niestety twoj regex nie jest prawidlowy a ty zapomniales jak wygladaja funkcje. szczegolenie ze dostales pelen skrypt w pierwszej iteracji,"nui,regex,heuristics,parser_correction"
8,ai-scripts/NUI_menus_scripts/0e_window.nss,"Re-analyzed script set using corrected detection pattern for NUI function calls (e.g., NuiSetBind, NuiOpen); Identified `0e_window.nss` as the core GUI handler; Detected JSON usage and full set of real NUI functions from `nw_inc_nui.nss` in that script.",Extract complete function map from `0e_window.nss`; Determine bind/event relationships and data flow; Compare JSON layout to examples from tutorials to identify custom behavior.,"Corrected function detection pattern; Mapped out actual usage of `NuiOpen`, `NuiDestroy`, `NuiGetEventPlayer`, and JSON structures in the script.",This iteration confirmed active usage of NUI and JSON GUI logic in `0e_window.nss`. Initial misclassification due to weak detection pattern was resolved. This file serves as the menu root.,teraz zrobimy podsumowanie do kolejnej iteracji; zrób jeszcze raz analizę skryptów w archiwum NUI_menus_scripts,"nui,json,function_detection,menu_handler"
