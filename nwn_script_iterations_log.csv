0,data-feed/nw_inc_nui.nss,Loaded and analyzed the file `nw_inc_nui.nss`; Identified constants (`const int/float/string`); Detected occurrences of components like `Nui*`; Recognized JSON variables building GUI structure.,Create a functionality map of `Nui*` based on names; Integrate constants with the GUI analyzer; Mark layout and component usage as metadata in the context index.,"Identified configuration data structures (constants, json, components); Prepared the data for further interpretation of NUI layouts in the analyzer.",The file `nw_inc_nui.nss` contains symbolic and component definitions for building NUI GUI. It does not define functions but is essential for understanding GUI structure in NWN:EE.,,
1,data-feed/Nui tutorial 1 basics - NWN Lexicon.html,Analyzed the tutorial file from NWN Lexicon; Identified 13 `Nui_*` and 12 `Json_*` functions; Extracted 2 code examples from `<pre>` tags.,"Tag which code examples can be transformed into reusable GUI skeletons; Map the usage of `Nui_Bind`, `Nui_Notify`, and `Nui_Open`; Create a basic GUI template based on the tutorial.",Recognized function set and practical structure for a simple GUI; Extracted window layout and event handling code fragments.,The tutorial provides a practical intro to building GUI with NUI. Structures and event hooks are ready for reuse in project scripts.,,
2,data-feed/Nui Performance Considerations - NWN Lexicon.html,"Loaded NUI performance guide from NWN Lexicon; Identified key sections regarding layout depth, cassowary solver, use of NuiSpacer/Margin, and problems with dynamic UI resizing.",Integrate performance warnings as heuristics for GUI analysis; Detect deep layout nesting and expensive widgets like spacers; Auto-append notes to `next_iteration` if performance risks are found.,"Formulated best practices checklist for building efficient UIs; Identified common pitfalls such as nesting, scaling, and buffer overuse.",The performance guide provides essential NUI optimization principles. Key takeaways will inform future layout and interaction analyses.,,
3,data-feed/Nui basic example - NWN Lexicon.html,"Analyzed full usage example of NUI from NWN Lexicon; Recognized components (`text`, `button`, `textedit`, `bind`, `notify`); Extracted JSON structure and open/handle cycle.",Turn the example into a reusable GUI skeleton in `ai-scripts/`; Automate detection of `bind` and `onClick`; Use JSON layout as a reference in GUI unit tests.,Extracted layout structure and identifiers for binds/events; Mapped event-response relationships in the interface.,Provides a solid reference implementation of a basic GUI window. Ready to be used as a foundation for project-level components.,,
4,data-feed/NUI - Neverwinter Nights 1_ EE - nwn.wiki.html,"Parsed full wiki documentation on NUI; Mapped layout structure from root to children; Grouped widgets, layouts, binds, drawlists, and event handling methods.","Link layout tree model to GUI analyzers as a reference; Organize sections into API groups (`NuiOpen`, `Bind`, `DrawList`); Create syntax schema for validating layout correctness in .nss.",Classified components and layout logic; Connected styling rules with functional layout and event logic; Clarified differences between DrawList and standard controls.,This wiki entry contains comprehensive structural and interactive NUI reference. Can be directly applied to model validation and automated parsing.,,
5,data-feed/Category_NUI Functions - NWN Lexicon.html,"Parsed the main NUI category index on NWN Lexicon; Extracted a complete list of function names and subpages; Grouped functions into widgets, layout, style, events, and system categories.",Extend the parsing to include all subpages for full API extraction; Link functions with occurrences in `.nss` scripts; Auto-fill `function_map` entries based on this index.,Classified NUI functions by type and role; Identified missing integration points between documentation and code analysis.,This file is the top-level function index and can serve as an authoritative source for building a structured API reference and linking code to docs.,,
