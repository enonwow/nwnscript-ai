Clarification — Dynamic Layout Construction and Live Updating (Iteration 14)

This entry captures confirmed rules and caveats related to building and updating NUI layouts dynamically.

==========================
1. Conditional Layouts (pre-render logic)
==========================
- Conditional logic (e.g., if/else) can be used to decide which components are added to the layout.
- This logic must be executed in NWScript *before* calling NuiOpen or NuiSetGroupLayout.
- Once layout is sent to the client, its structure is static — cannot conditionally hide/show without re-sending new layout.

==========================
2. Live Updating Layouts via NuiSetGroupLayout
==========================
- NuiSetGroupLayout can be safely called multiple times while a window is open.
- This is used to refresh parts of the GUI (e.g., live stats, selection).
- However, excessive updates (e.g. once per second) may have performance consequences, especially in older engine builds.

Guidance:
- Use timed or event-driven updates only when justified by UX needs.
- Avoid unnecessary redraws unless interactivity or visual feedback is expected.
